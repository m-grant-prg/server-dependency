NAME
dosab.sh - Take action depending on server availability during boot.
SYNOPSIS
dosab.sh [OPTION]
DESCRIPTION
This script reads a list of servers from the config file server.list and
determines whether they are contactable. If they are, commands stored in the
file server-name.available will be executed, if they are not, commands stored in
the file server-name.unavailable will be executed. The existence of these files
is not obligatory. Whilst this script could be run at any time, it is probably
most useful at boot via systemd or equivalent. The package contains a systemd
service file.
OPTIONS
-h, --help  prints usage information

-V, --version  prints version information
EXIT STATUS
0

1
