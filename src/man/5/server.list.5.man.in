NAME
server.list - List of servers whose availability is to be checked at boot.
DESCRIPTION
A simple list of server names. The Dependency On Server At Boot scripts check
during boot whether the servers are contactable. If they are, commands stored in
the file server-name.available will be processed, if not, commands held in the
file server-name.unavailable will be processed. It is not obligatory that either
of these files exist.
FILES
server.list
The file is stored in an etc directory. The exact location depends on the method
of installation but for Autotools installations on Linux this is likely to
be /usr/local/etc/dosab/server.list.
